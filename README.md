# Pacman

This is a Pacman game that runs in the terminal, written in C++.

When I first began programming, my first big project was Pacman. I wrote it in C++, with help from a friend. Looking back at it now, it's a horrifying mess. A load of spaghetti code in a single file. No classes, lots of global variables, and more hard coded values than can be counted. And it only ran on Windows.

This is my attempt at recreating it from scratch, the right way.

## Legacy code
